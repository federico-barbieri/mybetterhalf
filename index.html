  <p>This year, Zina's turning 33.<br>
  Just like Jesus. <br>And I don't know how many miracles <br>this so-called-Jesus has done, <br>but let me tell you this:</p><br>
  <h3>Zina's done quite a few.</h3>

      she does have dozens of people who truly believe in her.</h2>

    <h2 class="review-title">But don't take my word for it. Check what her followers have to say.</h2>


<!-- LIS -->

    <div class="lis slide">

      <img class="lis-picture" src="carousel/lis-test.jpeg" alt="">
      <h4 class="lis-h4">LIS KAYSER</h4>
      <p class="lis-p">I love Zina so much! She is not only the best roommate one could wish for,
        she is also a one-of-a-kind friend! She is an excellent cook
        (I can highly recommend her cinnamon buns, alfajors, rhubarb-jam, and all kinds of pastas).
        Zina is so curious of life, she makes you explore many new things yourself
        (incl. dry flower arrangements, beautiful gift wrapping techniques, redecorating your home).
        She is always in the mood for visiting a cool art exhibition and trying out the newest restaurants in town
        - or just order fantastic blue mussels at Fiskebar for the 100th time. She would never say no to grab a coffee
        and stroll around the streets of Vbro. Zina has the best humour, the most heart-warming laugh, and she can tell
        great stories. She is there for you when you need to talk to a good friend.
        She is there for you when you have to cry your eyes out.
        Everyone should have a Zina in their life! <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> </p>

<!-- SARAH -->

      <h4 class="sarah-h4">SARAH FALK</h4>
      <p class="sarah-p">10 Flowers out of 5. <br>
      If you don't have a Zina in your life,
      then you are truly missing out and should make this your primary mission.
      Look for the most beautiful, warmhearted, caregiving, creative and funloving
      person you can find, and then attempt to make a strong friendship.
      Try with gourmet food and wine, great attention to details,
      personal gestures and long walks.
      If you succeed, you will have the loveliest friend for life <i class="fas fa-heart"></i></p>

    </div>

<!-- LIV -->

    <div class="liv slide">

      <img class="liv-picture" src="carousel/liv-test.jpeg" alt="">
      <h4 class="liv-h4">LIV SKOVGAARD</h4>
      <p class="liv-p">Zina is my friend. One of my closest.
      She is one of a kind.
    She has a special kind of power and energy that inspires and challenges me, and other people as well.
  She has a fighter's heart, a grand personality and a creative mind.
We are very much alike and very different from each other.
Our friendship is almost life-long and has ups and downs, but we never lose sight of the love and respect for each other.
That's the way it is with family chosen by the heart.
Love you. </p>

<span>Fun fact1: This project started on June 7th, at your mom's place. </span>
<span>Fun fact2: I tried to buy the domain "mybetterhalf.com" but it's already taken by a specialized matrimonial service for muslims.</span>

<p>The truth is Jesus died for our sins.
But once you know Zina, you don't even feel like sinning.</p>
